# thesis-back-to-future-white-boy-with-hoverboard-christ
This states that a White boy with a hoverboard will come back from the future and save us. You will skate away on a hover board into the sunset. The future is my only concern. I am a computer scientist, if my calculations are correct, then the white boy on a hoverboard will never come and save us. That's heavy.

1. white people and children believe this
2. they create visions and fantasies
3. invisible people manipulate the visions
4. they will not save anyone
5. the white boy never shows up
6. they get angry
7. they fanstasize about the hoverboard
8. the hoverboard will CHANGE the world
9. all will be completed, my life complete, with hoverboard white boy hoverboard
